Got it üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a clean breakdown of the **User Story statement, description, and acceptance criteria** for instructing an RM on generating AI sections with Co-Pilot:

---

### **User Story Statement**

As an RM (Relationship Manager), I want clear instructions on how to generate AI-driven sections using Co-Pilot, so that I can quickly and consistently prepare client deliverables with accurate, pre-populated insights.

---

### **Description**

RMs often need to generate client deliverables that include AI-generated sections such as *Risks & Opportunities, Sector News, and Investment Goals*. To ensure consistency and efficiency, RMs should be provided with standard instructions and copy-paste friendly prompts for Co-Pilot. These prompts should guide the AI to generate concise, professional, and client-relevant summaries. The instructions should also outline how to review and validate AI outputs before finalizing them in the client deliverable.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Instructions Availability**

   * Clear step-by-step instructions are provided to RMs on how to use Co-Pilot.
   * Pre-written prompts for each section are available and easy to copy-paste.

2. **Coverage of Sections**

   * Instructions specify which sections are AI-generated (e.g., Risks & Opportunities, Sector News, Investment Goals).
   * Each section has a standard prompt template.

3. **Ease of Use**

   * Prompts are simple and consistent across all clients.
   * Instructions are accessible within the RM‚Äôs workspace/documentation.

4. **Output Review**

   * RMs can validate and edit Co-Pilot outputs before finalizing.
   * Guidance is provided on how to handle incomplete or irrelevant AI responses.

5. **Consistency & Standardization**

   * All RMs use the same process and prompts, ensuring standardized outputs across deliverables.
   * Outputs align with the client deliverable format and tone guidelines.

Would you like me to also **draft the exact standard prompts per section** (e.g., one for *Sector News*, one for *Investment Goals*, etc.) so RMs can just copy-paste directly into Co-Pilot?
