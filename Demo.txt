Here's a breakdown for the "Integrating and testing the code for news extraction using DuckDuckGo in NTAM cloud" story:
Story: Integrate and Test DuckDuckGo News Extraction in NTAM Cloud
As a [Role - e.g., Data Scientist, Backend Developer, Information Analyst]
I want to integrate and test the news extraction code using DuckDuckGo in the NTAM cloud environment
So that [Benefit - e.g., we can reliably collect up-to-date news articles for analysis, our data sources are expanded, our cloud-based data pipeline is enriched]
Description:
 * This story involves integrating a Python-based news extraction script that leverages the DuckDuckGo search API's news backend. The goal is to programmatically retrieve relevant news articles based on specified keywords or queries.
 * The code will be deployed and run within the NTAM cloud environment, ensuring it can scale and operate reliably. This includes setting up necessary dependencies, configurations, and environment variables.
 * Thorough testing will be conducted to validate the news extraction process, covering data accuracy, performance, error handling, and cloud environment compatibility.
 * The integration aims to establish a robust and automated mechanism for continuously feeding news data into our data processing pipelines within NTAM cloud.
Acceptance Criteria:
 * Successful News Extraction: The deployed code can successfully connect to the DuckDuckGo API, execute news searches for predefined queries, and extract relevant news article metadata (e.g., title, URL, snippet, publication date) into a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
 * Cloud Deployment & Execution: The news extraction code is successfully deployed as a runnable service/job within the NTAM cloud environment (e.g., as a Cloud Function, containerized application, or scheduled task) and executes reliably as scheduled or on demand.
 * Data Quality & Error Handling: Extracted news data is validated for correctness and completeness, and the system gracefully handles API rate limits, network errors, or malformed responses, with appropriate logging and alerts.
 * Performance & Scalability: The news extraction process completes within acceptable timeframes and demonstrates the ability to scale to handle increased query volumes or data extraction needs within NTAM cloud's resource allocation.
