## User Story

**Title:** Refine Company Overview Prompt after MVP1 Scope Changes

**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** the prompt used to generate the **Company Overview** section to be refined,
**So that** the generated summaries are aligned with the updated MVP1 scope (no NBA, no Wallet Share, improved focus on Client Summary, Client News, and Sector News).

---

## Description

* The original prompt for Company Overview included references to sections that are now **removed or renamed** (e.g., NBA, Wallet Share).
* The refined prompt should only generate content for the **current MVP1 scope**:

  * About the Company (client summary)
  * Client News
  * Sector News
  * Risks & Opportunities (renamed as "Next Best Actions" → dropped in MVP1, so not included)
* Ensure the prompt explicitly **excludes NBA and Wallet Share**.
* Prompt must be clear, concise, and usable by RMs for consistent Copilot interactions.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Criteria

1. A refined prompt for Company Overview is created.
2. Prompt excludes **NBA** and **Wallet Share** references.
3. Prompt includes only:

   * About the Company (client summary)
   * Client News (if available)
   * Sector News (if available)
4. Prompt must clearly instruct Copilot to generate concise, relevant, and structured outputs.

### Non-Functional Criteria

1. Prompt language must be RM-friendly (easy to copy-paste).
2. Output format must align with backend schema (`title`, `content`, `category`).
3. Prompt must be tested with sample client inputs to validate usefulness.
4. Version-controlled and documented alongside other RM prompts.

✅ **Done When:**

* A finalized Company Overview prompt is available.
* RMs can copy-paste it into Copilot to generate summaries aligned with MVP1 scope.

Would you like me to also **draft the refined Copilot prompt text** for the Company Overview so your RMs can use it right away?
