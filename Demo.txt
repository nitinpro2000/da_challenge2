Here's a breakdown for the "Update Snowflake Network Configuration in Python Connection Code" user story:
Story: Update Snowflake Network Configuration in Python Connection Code for NTAM Cloud
As a [Role - e.g., Data Engineer, Python Developer, DevOps Engineer]
I want to update the Snowflake Python connection code with the new NTAM cloud network configuration
So that [Benefit - e.g., our applications in NTAM cloud can securely and reliably connect to Snowflake, we adhere to NTAM cloud's network policies, we ensure data egress/ingress compliance]
Description:
 * This story involves modifying the existing Python code responsible for establishing connections to Snowflake. The primary change will be to incorporate new network configuration parameters specifically required for connectivity from the NTAM cloud environment.
 * This may include specifying proxy settings, private endpoint configurations, or whitelisting necessary IP ranges if the NTAM cloud employs strict network security policies for outbound connections.
 * The updated code will be thoroughly tested within the NTAM cloud environment to ensure successful, secure, and reliable connectivity to Snowflake without manual intervention.
 * The objective is to ensure all Python applications or services deployed in NTAM cloud can seamlessly and compliantly interact with Snowflake, leveraging the optimized and secure network path.
Acceptance Criteria:
 * Successful Snowflake Connection: The updated Python connection code, when executed from within the NTAM cloud environment, can successfully establish a secure connection to Snowflake, allowing for basic operations (e.g., executing a SELECT 1 query).
 * Network Configuration Applied: All specified NTAM cloud-specific network configuration parameters (e.g., proxy addresses, private endpoint configurations, explicit hostnames) are correctly implemented and utilized by the Python connection.
 * Secure & Compliant Connectivity: The connection to Snowflake from NTAM cloud adheres to all defined NTAM cloud network security policies and compliance requirements, ensuring data transfer is secure and within permitted network paths.
 * No Regression & Validation: The updated code does not introduce any regressions to existing Snowflake functionalities or connections from other authorized environments, and its functionality is validated through automated tests in the NTAM cloud setup.
