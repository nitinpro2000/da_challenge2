Hereâ€™s a more detailed expansion of your **Troubleshooting** section with clear checks and actions for each error type:

---

### Troubleshooting

#### **Database (DB) Errors**

* **Check connection parameters**: Ensure `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` are correctly set in the `.env` file.
* **Network/firewall issues**: Confirm the database host is reachable from your environment (try `ping` or `psql`).
* **Authentication issues**: Validate that the user has the correct permissions for the target database.
* **Migrations**: If tables are missing, check that database migrations have been applied.

---

#### **Authentication (Auth) Errors**

* **Bearer token**: Ensure the token is included in the request header:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```
* **Token expiry**: Verify that the token has not expired. Refresh or regenerate if needed.
* **Audience/scope mismatch**: Make sure the token has the correct scopes/roles for the API.
* **Environment mismatch**: Double-check you are using the correct UAT/DEV/PROD tokens.

---

#### **Agent Errors**

* **API Key validity**: Ensure `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) is set and valid.
* **Deployment name**: Confirm that the correct model deployment (`AZURE_OPENAI_TEXT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`, etc.) is referenced.
* **Logs**: Review application logs for detailed error messages (timeouts, invalid payloads, rate limits).
* **Quota issues**: Check if your Azure/OpenAI subscription has enough quota/credits.
* **Retries**: If requests fail intermittently, implement retry logic with exponential backoff.

---

#### **Import Errors**

* **PYTHONPATH**: Ensure the `src/` directory is added to your `PYTHONPATH`. Example:

  ```bash
  export PYTHONPATH=./src:$PYTHONPATH
  ```
* **Relative imports**: Use explicit relative imports (`from .module import Class`) when working inside packages.
* **Virtual environment**: Activate the correct venv where dependencies are installed.
* **Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to confirm all required packages are installed.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also add **step-by-step commands/checks** (like `psql`, `curl`, `python -m` examples) so the troubleshooting section becomes more practical?
