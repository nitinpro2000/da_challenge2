Hi \[Team Member's Name],

I wanted to clarify a couple of behavior points related to memo creation and retrieval:

1. **During Memo Creation:**
   After a user clicks "Create Memo", if `get_memo` is called before the backend process completes, should we:

   * Return an error message indicating the memo is not ready yet, or
   * Return partial memo data with the `output_content` omitted and `status` set to `"processing"`?

   Personally, I think returning partial data with a `"processing"` status is more informative for the client and aligns better with async processing patterns.

2. **When No Memos Exist for a User:**
   For the `list_memos` endpoint, if a user hasn’t created any memos yet, should we:

   * Return an error (e.g., 404 with a message like "No memos found"), or
   * Simply return an empty JSON object `{}` (or an empty array `[]`) with a 200 OK status?

   I’d suggest returning an empty response with 200 OK to keep it restful and avoid using 404 for valid but empty resource lists.

Let me know your thoughts so we can align implementation accordingly.

Best,
\[Your Name]
