Subject: API Mock Data - Clarification on ntam_client_since & logo
Hi [Client Name],
Hope you're having a good week.
As discussed, I've attached the API mock data for your review.
We have a couple of points we'd like to clarify to ensure accuracy:
 * ntam_client_since: The current data for this field is in a date format. We need to confirm with your team whether it should remain in date format or be converted to a year format.
 * logo: We need to get clarity on the exact type of data expected for the logo field (e.g., URL, base64 encoded string, etc.).
Please let us know your preferences on these points.
Thanks,
[Your Name]
