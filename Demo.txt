Hereâ€™s a **description** and **acceptance criteria** for implementing **Authorization using JWT token in a FastAPI backend**:

---

### âœ… **Feature Description: Authorization using JWT Token in FastAPI**

Implement secure **Authorization** in the FastAPI backend using **JWT (JSON Web Token)**. This mechanism ensures that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints. The token should be passed in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token. The backend must validate the token before granting access to any protected route.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Acceptance Criteria**

#### 1. **Token Generation**

* [ ] The backend should provide a `/login` or `/token` endpoint to generate a JWT token after validating credentials.
* [ ] The JWT should include necessary claims like `sub` (user ID or email), `exp` (expiry), etc.
* [ ] JWT token must be signed using a secure secret and algorithm (e.g., `HS256`).

#### 2. **Secure Token Handling**

* [ ] The token must be passed by the client in the `Authorization` header as:

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
  ```
* [ ] The backend should decode and verify the JWT for protected routes using a dependency.

#### 3. **Token Validation**

* [ ] Invalid or expired tokens must result in a `401 Unauthorized` response.
* [ ] Tokens with invalid signatures or incorrect structure must also be rejected.

#### 4. **Role-Based Access (Optional)**

* [ ] If implemented, routes should enforce authorization based on user roles/permissions present in the JWT claims.

#### 5. **Swagger UI Integration**

* [ ] The Swagger UI must include an `Authorize` button to enter the Bearer token.
* [ ] After authorization, users should be able to test protected endpoints directly from the Swagger interface.

#### 6. **Code Structure**

* [ ] JWT logic (encode/decode/verify) should be placed in a separate utility module (e.g., `auth.py`).
* [ ] Authorization dependencies should be reusable across different routes.

#### 7. **Security Best Practices**

* [ ] The secret key should not be hardcoded; it must be loaded from a secure environment variable.
* [ ] The token should expire in a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 15 mins to 1 hour).
* [ ] If refresh tokens are used (optional), they must be handled securely.
