Here’s a detailed **User Story Description** and **Acceptance Criteria** for handling **Weekly Historical News Data Extraction** with the given fields.

### **User Story: Weekly Historical News Data Extraction**

**As a** Data Engineer / System,
**I want** to extract, process, and store historical news articles on a weekly basis,
**So that** I can enable downstream systems and models (like LLMs or analytics tools) to retrieve relevant information about companies and industries based on their relevance and context.

---

### **Description:**

This feature focuses on the scheduled weekly ingestion and enrichment of historical news data. Each news article will be associated with metadata such as the company name, industry name, and other relevant information. Articles are scored and embedded using AI models to support semantic search, classification, and retrieval tasks.

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `company_name`        | The name of the company the article is related to                          |
| `industry_name`       | The name of the industry the company belongs to                            |
| `type_of_article`     | Type/category of article (e.g., news, opinion, press release)              |

| `article_URL`         | Source URL of the article                                                  |
| `article_search_term` | The search keyword(s) used to discover this article                        |
| `article_title`       | Title of the article                                                       |

| `article_text`        | Full text content of the article                                           |
| `date_of_extraction`  | The date the article was extracted into the system                         |
| `relevance_score`     | Score indicating relevance to company or topic (0 to 1 or a defined scale) |
| `article_embedding`   | Vector representation of article text for semantic search                  |

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

#### ✅ **AC1: Weekly Scheduled Job**

* The system must run a job every week to extract new historical articles.
* Job must complete within defined SLA (e.g., < 2 hours for 10,000 articles).

#### ✅ **AC2: Metadata Extraction**

* Each article must include:

  * `company_name`
  * `industry_name`
  * `type_of_article`
  * `article_id` (UUID or hash)
  * `article_URL`
  * `article_search_term`
  * `article_title`
  * `article_date`
  * `article_text`
  * `date_of_extraction` (must be the current date)

#### ✅ **AC3: Uniqueness Check**

* The system must avoid inserting duplicate articles (`article_id` must be unique).
* If duplicate found, it should log and skip or update based on policy.

#### ✅ **AC4: Relevance Scoring**

* Each article must be evaluated and assigned a `relevance_score` using predefined business or ML logic.
* Articles below a relevance threshold (e.g., score < 0.4) should be flagged or excluded if configured.

#### ✅ **AC5: Embedding Generation**

* For each article, generate a semantic embedding using a predefined model (e.g., Azure OpenAI).
* `article_embedding` must be stored in a vector-compatible database (e.g., pgvector or Azure AI Search).

#### ✅ **AC6: Queryable Format**

* The data must be stored in a structured format (e.g., Postgres, Parquet, etc.) with indexing to support downstream queries by company, date, industry, or relevance.

#### ✅ **AC7: Logging and Monitoring**

* Log success, failures, skipped articles, and embedding generation status.
* Alert if extraction fails or data volume is below expected threshold.

#### ✅ **AC8: Manual Triggering Option**

* Admins should be able to manually trigger the weekly job (e.g., via CLI or UI) if needed.
