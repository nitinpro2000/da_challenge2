Here's a **description** and **acceptance criteria** for implementing **Signature Verification in the FastAPI backend for SSO Authorization** (e.g., using Azure AD tokens or other JWT issuers):

## âœ… **Feature: Signature Verification for SSO Authorization in FastAPI Backend**

### ðŸ“˜ **Description:**

Update the FastAPI backend to **verify the digital signature of JWT tokens** issued by the SSO provider (e.g., Azure Active Directory, Auth0, Okta) during authorization. This will ensure the token was indeed issued by a trusted identity provider and **has not been tampered with**.

This security update will:

* Fetch and cache the **JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)** from the SSO provider's discovery URL.
* Use the public keys to verify the JWT **signature**.
* Ensure token claims like `aud`, `iss`, and `exp` are validated as per configuration.

### âœ… **Acceptance Criteria:**

| **ID** | **Criteria**             | **Description**                                                                                                         |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC1    | JWKS URL integration     | The backend should be configured with the correct JWKS endpoint of the SSO provider.                                    |
| AC2    | Public key verification  | Token signature must be verified using the public key from the JWKS.                                                    |
| AC3    | Verify standard claims   | The backend must validate standard claims like `iss` (issuer), `aud` (audience), and `exp` (expiration).                |
| AC4    | Fail unauthorized tokens | Tokens with invalid signature, expired tokens, or incorrect claims must return a `401 Unauthorized` response.           |
| AC5    | Middleware integration   | Signature verification should be implemented as a reusable dependency or middleware applied across protected endpoints. |
| AC6    | Logging                  | Invalid token signature or claims must be logged for audit/debugging without exposing sensitive information.            |
| AC7    | Swagger Authorization    | Token-based auth should still work through Swagger UI using a Bearer Token input.                                       |
| AC8    | Caching public keys      | Public keys from JWKS should be cached in memory (with a TTL) to avoid unnecessary repeated lookups.                    |
| AC9    | Unit Tests               | Unit tests must verify valid and invalid token behaviors (expired, tampered, invalid `aud`, etc.).                      |

---

### ðŸ“Œ Optional Enhancements:

* AC10: Support for multiple identity providers (optional).
* AC11: Auto-refresh cached JWKS keys on expiry or on key rotation.
* AC12: Include role-based access control using `roles` or `scp` claims (if available in token).
