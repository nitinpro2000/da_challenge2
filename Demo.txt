Got it üëç ‚Äî thanks for clarifying.
Since you‚Äôre **not refreshing individual connections** but instead **closing the pool and creating a new one every 8 hours with a refreshed token**, the user story and acceptance criteria will be slightly different.

### **User Story**

As a **developer**,
I want the PostgreSQL connection pool to automatically restart every 8 hours using a newly issued authentication token,
So that my application can maintain uninterrupted access to the database when tokens expire without requiring manual intervention.

---

### **Description**

* The system authenticates PostgreSQL using short-lived tokens (valid 8 hours).
* Instead of refreshing individual connections, the pool will be **closed and recreated** with the refreshed token at a scheduled interval.
* During the pool restart, existing requests should gracefully complete, and new requests should seamlessly use the new pool.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Automatic Pool Restart**

   * The system closes the existing connection pool and creates a new pool using the refreshed token every 8 hours.
   * The restart occurs before the current token expires (e.g., at 7h 55m).

2. **Graceful Transition**

   * Existing queries on the old pool are allowed to complete without interruption.
   * New queries after the refresh automatically route to the new pool.

3. **No Downtime**

   * The application continues serving requests without downtime during pool restart.
   * No query fails solely due to pool recreation.

4. **Error Handling**

   * If token retrieval or pool recreation fails, the system logs the error and retries (with exponential backoff).
   * In case of total failure, clear error messages are surfaced (`PoolRecreationFailed`, `TokenRefreshFailed`).

5. **Configurable Refresh Interval**

   * The refresh interval (default 8h) can be configured in application settings.

6. **Logging & Monitoring**

   * Logs include pool shutdown, new pool creation, and token refresh success/failure.
   * Metrics exposed: last pool restart time, restart duration, failure count.

---

‚úÖ **Definition of Done (DoD):**

* Pool recreation logic implemented.
* Application verified to run continuously beyond 8 hours without manual restart.
* Integration tests confirm queries succeed before, during, and after pool refresh.
* Error scenarios (failed token retrieval, failed pool recreation) tested and handled.

Would you like me to also **write a sample sequence diagram (mermaid code)** showing how this pool recreation works every 8 hours with ongoing queries? That way you can use it in design docs.
