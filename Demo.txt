Subject: API Mock Data - Clarification on "Other NTAM Clients"
Dear Team,
Please find the attached mock data file for the API endpoints.
We have one point we'd like to clarify to ensure accuracy:
 * Other NTAM Clients: We need to confirm with your team on how to fetch this data. Could you please provide guidance on the API or data source for this information?
Please let us know your thoughts on this.
Thanks,

Email 2
Subject: Snowflake Data Mapping & Clarification - [Your Project/Team Name]
Dear Oksana,
We have a few questions regarding the data we currently have in Snowflake and would appreciate your help in mapping some of the fields to the corresponding tables or business definitions.
Could you please assist us with the following:
1. Client Since Fields
 * ntam client since, nt client since: We would like to confirm that these fields would contain the inception date (and not the number of relationship years).
2. Wallet Share Data
 * client total investable assets
 * ntam percentage of client investable assets: We could not identify these fields in the sample data tables in Snowflake. Please direct us to the right fields or tables where this data resides.
3. NTAS Relationship
 * In the Product Summary section: Please share a sample output of this field and the logic to create it.
Your insights on these points would be greatly appreciated to help us proceed with the data integration.
Thank you,
[Your Name]
