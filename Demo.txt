Here’s a **user story** you can use to test **local access to PostgreSQL, Azure OpenAI, and Guardrails with UAT endpoints**:

---

### **User Story**

As a **developer**,
I want to validate local integration with **PostgreSQL**, **Azure OpenAI**, and **Guardrails**,
so that I can ensure the system works correctly with **UAT endpoints** before promoting to production.

---

### **Description**

The story will test connectivity and data flow across three components:

1. **PostgreSQL (local access):**

   * Verify local backend can connect to PostgreSQL instance.
   * Validate query execution (CRUD) and confirm expected schema access.

2. **Azure OpenAI (UAT endpoint):**

   * Ensure API calls from local backend reach Azure OpenAI UAT endpoint.
   * Test inference with a sample prompt and confirm response formatting.

3. **Guardrails integration:**

   * Validate request and response validation via Guardrails in UAT.
   * Confirm checks for input length, PII, toxicity, hallucination, and structure.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria** ✅

* **PostgreSQL Access**

  * Local backend can connect to UAT PostgreSQL DB with correct credentials.
  * Test query returns sample data from a known UAT table.

* **Azure OpenAI**

  * Backend can call Azure OpenAI UAT endpoint with valid API key.
  * Returns successful response with latency < 2s for a test prompt.

* **Guardrails**

  * Input prompt is validated (rejects malicious/invalid input).
  * LLM response is validated and passes guardrails checks.
  * Errors are logged with reason (e.g., “PII detected”).

* **End-to-End Test**

  * User sends a test request via local backend.
  * Backend fetches context from PostgreSQL.
  * Context + prompt sent to Azure OpenAI UAT endpoint.
  * Response passes through Guardrails and is returned to user.

---

Would you like me to also **write a test plan with sample test cases (Postgres connectivity test, Azure OpenAI API test, Guardrails validation test, full E2E test)** so you can execute step by step?



Got it 👍 Here’s a **separate user story** for updating **UAT environment variables** in your backend’s **Dockerfile and Helm charts**:

---

### **User Story**

As a **DevOps engineer**,
I want to update the **UAT environment variables** for the backend in the **Dockerfile and Helm charts**,
so that the application can connect to the correct UAT services during deployment.

---

### **Description**

This story ensures the backend uses the correct configuration when deployed in UAT:

1. **Dockerfile**

   * Inject UAT environment variables for PostgreSQL, Azure OpenAI, and Guardrails.
   * Ensure environment variables are configurable (not hardcoded).

2. **Helm Charts**

   * Update `values-uat.yaml` with UAT-specific secrets and configuration.
   * Reference these values in the `deployment.yaml` for container environment variables.

3. **Secrets/ConfigMaps**

   * Store sensitive credentials (DB password, API keys) in Kubernetes Secrets.
   * Non-sensitive values (e.g., feature flags, endpoints) in ConfigMaps.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria** ✅

* **Dockerfile**

  * No hardcoded credentials.
  * Supports passing env variables for `POSTGRES_URL`, `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `GUARDRAILS_ENDPOINT`.

* **Helm Charts**

  * `values-uat.yaml` includes correct UAT values for all required env variables.
  * Deployment manifest pulls env variables from `values-uat.yaml` and Kubernetes Secrets/ConfigMaps.

* **Verification**

  * When deploying to UAT using Helm, backend connects successfully to UAT Postgres, Azure OpenAI, and Guardrails.
  * Local build can override variables with `.env.uat` file for testing.
  * Sensitive values confirmed to be masked in logs.

---

👉 Do you want me to **write out the sample Helm chart snippet + Dockerfile changes** (showing how the UAT env vars would be passed), so your team can directly apply them?
