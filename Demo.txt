Here’s a clear and complete **user story** for updating SQL queries to parameterized queries using `asyncpg` in a Python backend:

### **User Story**: Update SQL Queries to Parameterized Queries using `asyncpg`

**Title**: Secure SQL Query Execution with Parameterized Queries in `asyncpg`

**Description**:
As a backend developer,
I want to update all raw SQL queries in the codebase to use parameterized queries with `asyncpg`,
So that I can prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities and ensure safer, more maintainable database interactions.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **All SQL queries must use `$1`, `$2`, etc., placeholders** instead of string concatenation or formatting.

   * ✅ Example:

     ```python
     await conn.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ($1, $2)", name, age)
     ```

2. **Any previous raw string SQL executions using `.format()` or `f-strings` must be refactored** to use parameterized execution.

3. **The code must use appropriate `asyncpg` methods** such as `.execute()`, `.fetch()`, `.fetchrow()`, or `.fetchval()` with parameter binding.

4. **Add input validation (optional but recommended)** before passing values to queries for data type correctness and business logic rules.

5. **All updated queries must be unit tested** or verified in integration tests to ensure no functional regressions.

6. **Code must follow PEP8 and internal coding standards** for readability and maintainability.

7. **A static code review or linter (optional)** should confirm that unsafe SQL constructions no longer exist in the updated modules.
