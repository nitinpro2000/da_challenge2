    This class serves as a service layer or data access object (DAO)

    database and potentially integrate with content generation mechanisms.
    It encapsulates the business logic related to memo persistence and modification.

        Generates new content based on provided details and then updates an
        existing memo record in the database with this content.

        This method orchestrates a two-step process: first, it processes
        the `details` to produce or derive memo content (potentially calling
        `self.generate_content`). Second, it invokes `self.update_memo_record`
        to persist this newly generated content, associating it with the
        specified memo and user.

        Args:
            memo_id (str): The unique identifier of the memo to be updated.
            user_id (str): The ID of the user performing the update, for auditing or authorization.
            details (dict): A dictionary containing parameters or raw data
                            from which the new memo content will be generated.

        Generates or processes content based on the provided input details.

        This method is responsible for the core logic of creating memo content.
        It might involve:
        - Applying templates.
        - Processing raw text.
        - Interacting with AI models for content generation.
        - Transforming input data into a structured memo body.

        Args:
            details (dict): A dictionary containing the necessary input data or
                            parameters for content generation.

        Returns:
            str: The generated or processed string content for the memo.

        Updates the content of an existing memo record in the database.

        This method connects to the database, constructs and executes an
        SQL UPDATE query to modify the 'content' field for the memo
        identified by `memo_id`. It typically also updates a 'last_modified'
        timestamp and potentially records the `user_id` performing the update.

        Args:
            memo_id (str): The unique identifier of the memo to be updated.
            user_id (str): The ID of the user performing the update. Used for auditing.

        Inserts a new memo record into the database based on the provided JSON data.

        This method is responsible for the initial creation of a memo.
        It parses the `request_json`, extracts relevant memo attributes
        (e.g., title, content, author, timestamps), establishes a database
        connection, and executes an SQL INSERT query to store the new memo.
        It typically generates a unique ID for the new memo.

        Args:
            request_json (dict): A dictionary representing the JSON payload
                                 from an incoming request, containing all
                                 necessary data to create a new memo.

            dict: A dictionary representing the newly created memo record,
                  typically including its generated ID and creation status.
                  Returns None or raises an exception on failure.
