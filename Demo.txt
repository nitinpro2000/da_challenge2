Hereâ€™s a clear set of **news extraction steps** you can document based on your process:

### News Extraction Steps

1. **Prepare Prompts**

   * Create two prompts for each company:

     * **Company News Prompt** â€“ asks for latest news specific to the client/company.
     * **Industry News Prompt** â€“ asks for broader sector or industry-level updates.

2. **Use Co-Pilot for Extraction**

   * Copy and paste the prepared prompts into Co-Pilot.
   * Co-Pilot generates the response in **Markdown text format**.

3. **Review & Validate Output**

   * Check the extracted **Company News** and **Industry News** for relevance, completeness, and accuracy.
   * If needed, refine the prompt and re-run to improve results.

4. **Update Prefetch Sections in Database**

   * Go to the `prefetch_sections` table in PostgreSQL.
   * Locate the entry corresponding to the company.
   * **Manually paste** the extracted Company News and Industry News into the respective columns.

5. **Save & Verify**

   * Save changes in the database.
   * Run a quick query or API call (if available) to confirm that the news is correctly updated in `prefetch_sections`.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also give you an **automated flow** (so you donâ€™t need to manually paste into Postgres every time), e.g., using Python + asyncpg to fetch prompts, call Co-Pilot/OpenAI, and update the table?
