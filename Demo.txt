Auto-Owners Insurance is a prominent insurance provider managing a $13 billion portfolio, primarily in-house, with
selective outsourcing to external managers for strategies like small-cap and structured investments. [11] \n - NTAM
maintained a strong relationship with Auto-Owners by emphasizing service efficiency and customer commitment. Positiv
client feedback highlights satisfaction with specific team members and NT’s responsiveness, including adjustments t
fees to retain the custody business despite competitive pressures. [7][8][9] \n - The client is focused on yield-
enhancing strategies within conservative parameters, increasing private equity exposure from 1.5% to 3%, and
prioritizing inflation protection, recently adding $130MM in inflation-protected securities to meet a 5% allocatio
target. They have also expressed openness to outsourcing life company assets but are navigating internal politica
challenges. [12][13][11] \n\n### Risks \n - Interest in transitioning to a more efficient account-opening process
requires follow-up to ensure alignment with the client's expectations. [14] \n - Select areas like opportunistic
residential and European commercial real estate represent gaps in NTAM expertise, which could limit NT’s role in
providing holistic solutions. [16] \n\n### Opportunities \n - Scheduling focused discussions on NTGI’s small-cap
structured strategies and Target Date capabilities could deepen the client relationship and address their strategio
needs. \n - Developing tailored investment ideas, such as private equity strategies and inflation-protected securitie
directly aligns with the client’s objectives and could secure additional business.
