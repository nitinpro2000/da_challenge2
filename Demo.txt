Perfect âœ… â€” letâ€™s enrich the **Backend Onboarding FAQ** with a dedicated section on **Testing Framework & Strategy**, incorporating your current process (FastAPI Swagger UI, Postman for QA, AI result validation, and static data checks).

# Backend Onboarding FAQ (FastAPI + Semantic Kernel)

### **1. Project Setup**

*(same as before â€“ environment, dependencies, run locallyâ€¦)*

---

### **2. FastAPI Basics**

*(routes, entrypoint, docs, adding new endpointsâ€¦)*

---

### **3. Semantic Kernel (AI Agents)**

*(skills, agents, adding new agent, context handlingâ€¦)*

---

### **4. Database**

*(Postgres, pgvector, migrations, connection stringsâ€¦)*

---

### **5. Docker & Deployment**

*(docker-compose, Helm, Kubernetes, CI/CDâ€¦)*

---

### **6. Async Pitfalls**

*(blocking code, unawaited coroutines, background tasks, event loopsâ€¦)*

---

### **7. Testing Framework & Strategy**

#### **Frameworks/Tools in Use**

* **FastAPI Swagger UI** (`/docs`) â†’ For initial smoke tests and quick endpoint validation.
* **Postman (QA team)** â†’ For manual/automated test collections in different environments (DEV/UAT/PROD).
* **Pytest** (recommended for devs) â†’ For writing unit/integration tests.

#### **Testing Strategy**

1. **API Endpoint Testing**

   * Developers: Use **Swagger UI** during development to confirm inputs/outputs.
   * QA: Use **Postman collections** with environment variables for repeatable test runs.

2. **AI-Generated Results**

   * Compare LLM/agent output against:

     * **Source call reports** (to validate factual correctness).
     * **External datasets/APIs** (to verify grounding and reduce hallucinations).
   * Apply **Guardrails validation** on both input and output for PII, toxicity, and hallucination checks.

3. **Static Data APIs**

   * Compare **API output vs. database state** directly.
   * Example: query DB with `psql` or `asyncpg` and match against FastAPI response.
   * Ensures no transformation/serialization errors.

4. **Automated Unit Tests (Dev)**

   * Write **pytest** tests under `tests/` folder.
   * Use FastAPIâ€™s `TestClient` for endpoint testing:

     ```python
     from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
     from src.main import app

     client = TestClient(app)

     def test_health_check():
         response = client.get("/health")
         assert response.status_code == 200
         assert response.json() == {"status": "ok"}
     ```

5. **Integration Tests**

   * Spin up services with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up`.
   * Run API calls against the running stack.
   * Validate DB state changes and end-to-end flow (e.g., ingestion â†’ embeddings â†’ retrieval â†’ response).

6. **Regression Testing**

   * Maintain a **Postman regression suite** with versioned expected outputs.
   * Compare agent outputs against historical benchmarks to catch drifts.

7. **Performance/Load Testing**

   * Optional: Use **Locust** or **k6** to test concurrency and throughput.
   * Useful for DB-heavy endpoints and AI calls with batching.

### **8. Troubleshooting**

*(DB, Auth, Agent, Import, Docker, Async issuesâ€¦)*

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also design a **testing workflow diagram** (Dev â†’ QA â†’ AI validation â†’ DB validation) so onboarding docs show **who tests what, where, and how**? Thatâ€™ll make it crystal clear for new joiners.
