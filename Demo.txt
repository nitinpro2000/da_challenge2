Here's a **User Story**, **Description**, and **Acceptance Criteria** for the task:

### **User Story**

**Title**: Update Application Design Document with Sequence Diagrams for APIs and Flow Diagrams for Agents

**As a** system architect or technical lead,
**I want to** update the application design documentation with accurate sequence diagrams for APIs and flow diagrams for agents,
**so that** the technical team and stakeholders can clearly understand the system behavior, data flow, and agent orchestration for maintenance, onboarding, and scaling.

---

### **Description**

The task involves updating the application design documentation to reflect the current implementation. This includes:

1. **API Sequence Diagrams**:

   * For each major API (e.g., Create Memo, Approve Regeneration, Get Client Info), include a detailed sequence diagram showing:

     * Actor (Frontend / User)
     * API Gateway or FastAPI layer
     * Business logic or service layer
     * Database or async operations
     * Response structure
   * These diagrams should be updated to reflect the latest async behavior, validations (e.g., Guardrails), and backend architecture.

2. **Agent Flow Diagrams**:

   * Each autonomous or orchestrated agent (e.g., LinkedIn Agent, Fusion Agent, Sentiment Agent) should have a **flow diagram (Mermaid / BPMN / Lucid)** that includes:

     * Trigger conditions
     * Data source and enrichment steps
     * Communication between agents (if multi-agent system)
     * LLM prompt-response interactions
     * Final output and any feedback loop

3. **Documentation Update**:

   * Embed these diagrams in the official design document (Markdown / Word / Confluence).
   * Each diagram should be accompanied by a brief explanation.

| AC5 | The diagrams are included in the **project documentation repository** (e.g., GitHub Wiki or Confluence) | Delivery   |
| AC6 | Diagrams use a **consistent notation** (e.g., Mermaid.js, UML, BPMN)                                    | Quality    |
| AC7 | Document is peer-reviewed and marked as “Updated” in version history or change log                      | Process    |
