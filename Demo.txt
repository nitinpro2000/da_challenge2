Here’s a user story to **update the error traceback message along with the error message for failed memos**, written in agile format:

---

### **User Story**

**Title:** Update error traceback and error message for failed memos

**As a** developer or support engineer,
**I want** the system to store and display both the error message and the full traceback when a memo fails to process,
**So that** I can debug issues faster and have better context for resolution during support or root cause analysis.

---

### **Description:**

Currently, only a generic error message is stored/logged when memo processing fails. This is not sufficient to identify the exact root cause during debugging. This user story aims to enhance the error handling mechanism by storing both:

* A clear error message summarizing the issue
* The complete error traceback (stack trace) for deep technical insight

This information should be saved in the memo processing status metadata (e.g., in the `error_message` and `error_traceback` fields in the database or logging system) and made accessible through the appropriate internal APIs or logs.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria:**

1. ✅ **Error message and traceback captured**

   * When a memo processing attempt fails (e.g., during regeneration or approval), both the error message and full Python traceback are captured.

2. ✅ **Stored in DB/log system**

   * The error message is stored in the `error_message` field.
   * The full traceback is stored in the `error_traceback` field (or appended to the same log record if logging is used).

3. ✅ **Visible in failure response (optional)**

   * For internal or debugging environments (e.g., staging), error message and traceback should be retrievable through an API endpoint (e.g., `GET /memos/{id}/status`) with appropriate permissions.
   * For production, only a sanitized message is returned to end users (traceback hidden).

4. ✅ **No PII or sensitive data in traceback**

   * Traceback must be reviewed/sanitized to ensure no sensitive data (e.g., tokens, passwords, PII) is exposed.

5. ✅ **Backward compatible**

   * If `error_traceback` does not exist in older records, the system handles it gracefully.

6. ✅ **Test coverage**

   * Unit/integration tests validate that error and traceback are correctly stored and retrieved.

7. ✅ **Logging for audit/debugging**

   * The failure (with message and traceback) is logged in the system logs with a timestamp and memo ID.
