Here’s a well-defined **User Story** and **Acceptance Criteria** for implementing **observability tracking** that logs **time taken by each API or Agent into a PostgreSQL table**.

---

### ✅ **User Story**

**Title**: Track API and Agent Execution Time for Observability

**As a** developer or system owner,
**I want** to track and store the execution time of each API endpoint and agent function call in a PostgreSQL table,
**So that** I can monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and improve system reliability and responsiveness.

---

### ✅ **Description**

For every API request or agent execution, the system should automatically capture metrics such as:

* API/Agent name
* Start time
* End time
* Total duration (in ms)
* Status (success/failure)
* Timestamp
* Additional metadata (e.g., user ID, request ID, input size)

These metrics should be inserted into a PostgreSQL table in near-real-time, using asynchronous calls to avoid blocking the main logic.

### ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**

| ID  | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC1 | When an API endpoint is hit, the start time and end time are recorded, and the duration is calculated accurately.                                                                                                |
| AC2 | When an Agent function is called, its name, duration, and execution status are logged similarly.                                                                                                                 |
| AC3 | A PostgreSQL table named (e.g., `observability_metrics`) exists with columns: `id`, `name`, `type` (API/Agent), `start_time`, `end_time`, `duration_ms`, `status`, `created_at`, and `metadata` (optional JSON). |
| AC4 | Metrics are inserted into the table asynchronously using `asyncpg` or similar library without blocking the request/response cycle.                                                                               |
| AC5 | Errors in metric logging (e.g., DB down) do not affect the main API/Agent execution. Failures are logged for retries.                                                                                            |
| AC6 | The tracking logic is encapsulated in a reusable class (e.g., `ObservabilityTracker`) or middleware for consistent integration.                                                                                  |
| AC7 | A test endpoint or dummy agent call demonstrates the correct data insertion into the table with at least 2–3 metrics.                                                                                            |
| AC8 | The system supports adding custom tags/metadata for advanced filtering later (e.g., user ID, client name, environment).                                                                                          |
