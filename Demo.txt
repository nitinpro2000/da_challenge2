Hereâ€™s a **User Story** and corresponding **Acceptance Criteria** for adding **docstrings and comments** to your codebase. This can be used in tools like Jira, Azure DevOps, Trello, etc.

### âœ… **User Story**: Add Docstrings and Code Comments

**Title:**
Add Docstrings and Inline Comments to Improve Code Readability and Maintainability

**As a**
developer or team member working on this codebase,
**I want**
every class, method, and function to have clear and complete docstrings and inline comments,
**so that**
the code is easier to understand, maintain, and extend by current and future developers.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **Description:**

The current codebase lacks comprehensive docstrings and inline comments. This story aims to add:

* Class-level and function-level docstrings that describe **purpose**, **parameters**, **return types**, and **behavior**
* Inline comments for **complex logic**, **business rules**, or **non-obvious operations**
* A consistent docstring style across the codebase (Google-style, NumPy-style, or Sphinx-style)

### âœ… **Acceptance Criteria:**

| Criteria ID | Description                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AC1         | Each class has a docstring explaining its purpose and key attributes or behaviors.                         |
| AC2         | Each method/function has a docstring describing its input parameters, return values, and logic.            |
| AC3         | Non-obvious blocks of logic (e.g., complex conditionals, calculations) are annotated with inline comments. |
| AC4         | Docstrings follow a consistent format (e.g., Google-style or PEP 257).                                     |
| AC5         | Code is reviewed to ensure that no important function is left undocumented.                                |
| AC6         | Comments do not repeat what the code does literally but add value by explaining "why" or clarifying "how." |
| AC7         | Final code passes static analysis/linter checks for documentation (e.g., flake8-docstrings if applicable). |

---

### ðŸ›  Optional Technical Notes:

* Use tools like **pydocstyle**, **flake8-docstrings**, or **interrogate** to validate completeness.
* Markdown/Word documentation can be generated from the docstrings using **Sphinx**, **pdoc**, or **Docstring-to-Docx** plugins.

Let me know if you want this exported to a `.md`, `.docx`, or Jira-friendly format, or need a version tailored to a specific task management tool.
