I need a Gherkin feature file written using Scenario Outlines, not regular Scenarios. Each Scenario Outline should include placeholders for variables and an Examples table to provide values for those placeholders. Ensure the feature and scenario outlines adhere to proper Gherkin syntax. Use concise, realistic examples relevant to [your domain, e.g., e-commerce, banking, etc.]. Avoid providing plain scenarios; convert them to Scenario Outlines with parameterized steps and examples.
